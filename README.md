# F1-Website üèé
222 Final Project ( 1st yr - 2nd sem)


This Project is intended for the submission of our CCS 222 Subject which is to create a website with the use of HTML, CSS, and JS.

The Content is all about my favorite hobbies, which is to watch Formula 1, with this, I took it as a challenge to make an F1 Website with a game-like interface. 

Hopefully you may enjoy my website!
